    <h2>IO500</h2>

    <p>
        The IO-500 has been developed together with the community and its development is still ongoing. The benchmark is essentially a benchmark suite bundled with execution rules. It harnesses existing and trusted open source benchmarks.
    </p>

    <p>
        The goal for the benchmark is to capture user-experienced performance. It aims to be:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Representative</li>
        <li>Understandable</li>
        <li>Scalable</li>
        <li>Portable</li>
        <li>Inclusive</li>
        <li>Lightweight</li>
        <li>Trustworthy</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Lists</h3>

    <p>
        We publish multiple lists for each BoF at SC and ISC as well as maintaining the current most up-to-date lists. We publish a <strong>Historic List</strong> of all submissions received and multiple filtered lists from the historic list. We maintain a <strong>Full List</strong> which is the subset of submissions which were valid according to the set of list-specific rules in place at the time of the listâ€™s publication.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our primary lists are <strong>Ranked Lists</strong> which show only opted-in submissions from the <strong>Full List</strong> and only the best submission per storage system. We have two ranked lists: the <strong>IO500 List</strong> for submissions which ran on any number of client nodes and the <strong>10 Node Challenge</strong> list for only those submissions which ran on exactly ten client nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, for each BoF, we have the following lists:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Historic list</strong>: all submissions ever received</li>
        <li><strong>Full list</strong>: the subset from the historic list that was valid</li>
        <li><strong>IO500 List</strong>: the subset from the full list with only the best submission per storage system</li>
        <li><strong>10 Node Challenge List</strong>: the subset from the full list with only the best submission per storage system ran on exactly ten nodes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Workloads</h3>

    <p>
        The benchmark covers various workloads and computes a single score for comparison. The workloads are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>IOEasy</strong>: Applications with well optimized I/O patterns</li>
        <li><strong>IOHard</strong>: Applications that require a random workload</li>
        <li><strong>MDEasy</strong>: Metadata/small objects</li>
        <li><strong>MDHard</strong>: Small files (3901 bytes) in a shared directory</li>
        <li><strong>Find</strong>: Finding relevant objects based on patterns</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The individual performance numbers are preserved and accessible via the web or the raw data. This allows deriving other relevant metrics.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are in the process to establish a procedure to extend the current workload with further meaningful metrics.
    </p>
