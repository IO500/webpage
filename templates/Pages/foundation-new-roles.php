    <h3>IO500 Foundation New Roles Rules</h3>

    <p>
        The IO500 Foundation can create new roles with the following rules:
    </p>

We expand the IO500 Foundation to include a new class of members separate from the Committee. Generally, we consider that any member of the IO500 foundation is crucial to the operation and the reputation of the IO500 foundation, therefore, the rules are formulated in favor of a conservative and protective strategy. 

The occupants of these additional roles are officially announced on the “about” page beneath the Committee.


<p> Web Designer </p>


Responsibilities
<ol>
<li>The responsibilities include maintaining website working status and working on requested changes as driven by issues submitted to the Github site for the website. These issues can be submitted by anyone including the community, Committee, and the Web Designer themselves.</li>

<li>The Web Designer will have access to IO500 submission prior to public disclosure as part of performing their duties and is required to guarantee the confidentiality of those submissions on penalties including immediate dismissal.</li>

<li>The Web Designer is required to share with the committee all relevant passwords and accounts as they are created and/or changed.</li>
</ol>

Management structure
<ol>
<li>The Web Designer reports to the whole Committee using the GitHub issues and the dedicated Slack channel.</li>

<li>The Web Designer will not be allowed or asked to vote on any Committee issues.</li>

<li>The Web Designer will not have access to the shared IO500 Google Drive, nor the meeting minutes since they include sensitive information.</li>

<li>This Web Designer’s Slack access will be limited to a new private slack channel dedicated to the role and will not have access to the other private Committee channels except as deemed necessary based on future Committee unanimous consent. </li>

<li>The role is perpetual unless the person resigns. At any time, if one Committee member has a concern with the position, s/he can discuss the matter in a timely fashion with the Committee, if the concerns of the Committee member cannot be resolved in the Committee discussion, the current Web Designer is removed immediately based on a majority vote. Prior to notifying the web designer, all passwords and password recovery methods must be changed/verified to remove the web designer’s access. This would include the webpage github, hosting, disqus, email lists, slack, and any other related functions.</li?
</ol>

Salary
<ol>
<li>As with all roles with IO500 Foundation, this is an unpaid position.</li>
</ol>
